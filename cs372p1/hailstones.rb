In 1937, Lothar Collatz, a German mathematician, suggested that the following result is always true:
Start with a positive integer. If that integer is an even number, halve it. If it is odd, triple it and add
one. Continuing this with the resulting integers will always cause you to reach one, sooner or later. What
makes this process interesting is that no one has been able to prove that the sequence will reach one
for every positive integer, but every number ever tested (over 5 Ã— 10^8 of them) has. This conjecture is
known by many names, including the Collatz Conjecture and the Hailstone Sequence.

    number = number * 3 + 1
